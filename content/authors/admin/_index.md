I am a third-year Ph.D. student in International Business Administration with a concentration in Finance in the Division of International Banking and Finance Studies of the A. R. Sanchez, Jr. School of Business at Texas A&M International University in Laredo, TX.

I received my masters (MS) (dual degree) in Economics and Data Science from South Dakota State University in 2019, and my BA in Economics from the University of Cape Coast, Ghana in 2016.

I am a certified Financial Modeling & Valuation Analyst (FMVA).

My research is currently in empirical corporate finance, financial econometrics, and international business.

I also have an interest in economics & statistical techniques.
